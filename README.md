A MacOS Application version exsists, however I am not currently paying apple $100 a year to be a signed developer, and my apps will not open by usual means. Read more about it here https://cycling74.com/forums/standalone-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash/.
If you know what you're doing and want to try opening it with terminal commands or by disabling your safety settings (I do not recommend this) then here is a link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drHU8iKporev-Hwe50Ll7FGBzywCv6_z/view?usp=sharing
